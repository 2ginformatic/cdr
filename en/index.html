            <p>The origin of life on Earth can be dated to a period between 4.4 billion years ago, when liquid water appeared on the earth's surface. It is believed, however, that life originated around 3.9 billion years, when the earth began to cool down to a temperature at which water could be widely found in the liquid state. The findings of microbial structures dating back 3.7 billion years ago in Greenland confirm this.</p>

              <p>When we ask ourselves Who are we? We realize that we have no suitable words because words like soul, spirit, etc. They have external connotations of a different nature, falling within the field of metaphysics and the philosophy of love. In fact, it would not be an inner question if other people answered it. One gradually loses himself in his thoughts and in what he is writing, until in a natural way, finally, words emerge, words that are not words but poetry. Words that mean only what one feels at that moment!</p>

            <p>Man, without doubt, is the number one enemy of biodiversity. An enemy that cannot therefore be eliminated. Rather, conservation requires a deep understanding of the complex links between the environment and human populations. Of course this is not a simple undertaking. Very often, to complicate the task of conservationists, there is a close link between the so-called hot spots, ie sites particularly rich in biodiversity, and poverty.</p>
